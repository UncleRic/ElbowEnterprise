ElbowEnterprise
===============
'Elbow Enterprise' is a proof-of-concept of having ancillary UIViewControllers available via left & right 'sheets' that are accessed using left/right gestures, respectively.

The code is based on what I wrote upon a given project template for a potential employer to demonstrate how to have left & right 'drawers' of bona fide UIViewControllers.

**Modus Operandi** <br/>
I placed a navigational view upon the table to intercept finger events; from which to interpret finger gesturers whilst allowing table scrolling.
