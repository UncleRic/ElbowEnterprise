ElbowEnterprise
===============

'Elbow Enterprise' is a proof-of-concept of having slidable UIViewControllers.  
The code is based on what I wrote upon a given project for a potential employer to demonstrate how to have left & right 'drawers' of bona fide UIViewControllers.

**Modus Operandi**
I placed a navigational view upon the table to intercept finger events; from which to interpret finger gesturers whilst allowing table scrolling.
